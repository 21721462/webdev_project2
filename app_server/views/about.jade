            h2 How the matching algorithm works
            p The matching algorithm works by grouping players based on selected criteria the user chooses.  
                | The algorithm first selects one of the user's games, and runs a query on the database to 
                | find other users who also play that game. The algorithm accepts personal preferences for 
                | finding users based on a specific age, rank and location. Additionally, the algorithm 
                | can limit the number of players returned, but with a maximum of 10. If the user doesn't have 
                | any games, then the default matching algorithm returns users that play any game with the number of 
                | matches specified.

            h2 The architecture that was used
            p The website uses an MVC architecture. Whenever the server receives a request, it gets sent to the 
                | router. The router then selects the appropriate controller for the request. If needed, the 
                | controller can query the database to retrieve the required information, and then construct 
                | an appropriate response. After the controller has finished, it renders a HTML page from a 
                | template to display on the screen.

            h2 The design choices made along the way
            p One design choice we made was to allow for steam integration in the registration. This way, users can 
                | log in with their steam account and the registration data can be auto-filled. The data auto-filled
                | includes the users name, username and location. Another design choice was to implement our own 
                | ranking system. This was to help users find matches with other users that have the same ability as them.

        .shadow
            h2 Any difficulties faced along the way
            p The steam integration service was extremely time-consuming and difficult to implement. The mongoose-friends 
                | library has an issue where friends cannot be deleted. This is an ongoing issue on their GitHub repository. 
                | Using the MongoDB databases was a challenge as they did not support SQL-like joins. This made querying 
                | the database tedious, and a lot of work arounds had to be implemented. Converting the HTML files to 
                | Jade was quite difficult at the start, as it was a completely new language that we had to learn from 
                | scratch.
                | Another major issue we faced was the issue of not being able to pass a array/object from the contoller to 
                | the view containing each steam users games and their cooresponding play times. Jade kept on saying 
                | the array/object was undentified. If this worked the register page would have been able to determine 
                | what games were present in the steam users game libray and select those for him automatically. 
                | Mongoose-friends sometimes results in a error, this is most likely due to the remove friend feature being 
                | broken. Due to the issues with css and lack of time the game selection images on the registration page are 
                | slightly buggy.

            h2 Tests, validation, and results
            p No tests cases were done due to time constraints. However data validation was implemented on login, registration, 
                | and account updates. For any of these pages, if the user enters incorrect data, an error message will be
                | displayed at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, each of these pages supports both client-side and
                | server-side validation to ensure that no bad values are stored in the database.
